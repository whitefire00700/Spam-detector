Install the "natural language processing" TextBlob library TextBlob is also available as a conda package. To install with conda, run $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/sloria textblob $ python -m textblob.download_corpora For more details install from https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/install.html .
